General information (not story specific) In the City of Vancouver, we have the mandate and regulation authority to set GHG emissions limits / prescriptive equipment use. Rather than energy efficiency (which Step Code supports, meaning fossil fuels are not diminished at nearly the same rate) we are focused on electrifying mechanical equipment and appliances. With supporting focus on improving the envelope to reduce heating / cooling loads.

So while Vancouver homes will likely not hit high levels of the Step Code, they will achieve significant GHG reductions.
